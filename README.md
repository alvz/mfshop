# Mfshop
A simple online shop written in PHP , **Yii Framework** and MySQL. This was my first Yii Project which I wrote a long time ago to learn the basics of this great framework. To get more information about Yii please refer to its official site at www.yiiframework.com .

Mfshop is a non-professional project so it may have bugs or lack some features but it can be a good start for those who want to start learning Yii Framework. The development of this project is no longer in progress and any issue will be simply ignored so use it at your own risk. I suggest you to first read Yii docs and its sample project called 'Blog' to get familiar with the framework and then check out Mfshop to learn more.

## Main features
1.  Users management: Login/logout/register
2.	Products management
3.	Image upload
4.	Image gallery
5.	FAQ
6.	News management
7.	Comments management
8.	Theming
9.	Users' carts management
10.	Admin module
11.	And some other things which I don't remember :)

## Technologies
1. PHP/HTML/CSS
2. **Yii Framework**
3. MySQL
4. jQuery (including AJAX)

The version of Yii which I used was 1.1.7 but it should work with any other version greater than that. For database you can use the SQL script file which can be found in the root directory of the project.

**user/pass for login page: admin/admin**

Good luck!
